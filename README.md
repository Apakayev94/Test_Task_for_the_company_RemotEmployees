Good day
My name is Alexander
It was interesting and rewarding to do this task! Too bad it's such a short time.
Thank you very much for the opportunity!

Implementation time was running out
There was no time to check for code duplication and test for adaptation to different screen widths
Also in Latin
I know that my layout is not perfect and there are problems in it,
But I tried as best I could and tried to do it as quickly as possible!
Looking at the code, you will see that the layout is in some places percentage, and such a layout has disadvantages, but due to the time limit, I had to do it this way, since it takes less time!
There is one more thing about sliders, if in section 1 it is clear that it changes the background image, then in the remaining sections it is not clear, I did it in haste as I understood, since there were no clear explanations and instructions.

My display extension for which I adapted the layout is 1920 x 1080.

I'm waiting for feedback!
Have a nice day!
And thanks a lot!
